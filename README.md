## Advantages of Using WebRTC and WebSocket

- **WebRTC:**
  - Enables direct peer-to-peer communication, reducing server load.
  - Provides high-quality audio and video streaming with minimal latency.
  - Supports NAT traversal using STUN/TURN servers for reliable connectivity.

- **WebSocket:**
  - Maintains a persistent, full-duplex communication channel between client and server.
  - Facilitates real-time signaling required for establishing WebRTC connections.
  - Offers efficient message exchange, crucial for session control and management.
